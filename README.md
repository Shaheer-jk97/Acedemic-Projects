# Legendary-Pokemon
This pipeline is my first ever end-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline, tasked as a end of module project.
In this pipeline I train set out to see if Machine learning models can predict the Legendary Status of Pokemon,based on their Attack, Defense, Health Points Stats.
The dataset i choose can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon, it contains all the necessary information of all 7 generation of pokemon.
